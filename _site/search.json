I completed my undergraduate degree in Business Administration at Boston University, where I concentrated in Marketing and Global Business, and minored in International Relations. It became my passion to understand the complex relationships between peoples and businesses, whether that be on a social level or through numbers.\nThis became especially apparent when I took classes in marketing research and analytics. I fell in love with the idea of connecting numbers, understanding what those numbers actually mean, and creating an actionable outcome. Data is really like one big puzzle!\nBeyond my academic pursuits, I am an adventurer. Throughout my undergraduate expereince, I was a member of the track and field team. I am lucky to also compete at the D1 level at UCI. I enjoy any outdoor activity, including running, hiking, camping, etc. One of my goals in life it to go to every national park!"
